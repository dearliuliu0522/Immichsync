# ImmichSync

ImmichSync is a macOS app that syncs Immich assets to a local folder and can automatically upload new files back to your server.

## Install (unsigned build)

1) Download `ImmichSync.dmg` or `ImmichSync.zip` from GitHub Release assets.  
2) Open the DMG/ZIP and drag `ImmichSync.app` to `/Applications`.  
3) If macOS blocks it, right‑click the app → **Open**, or allow it in System Settings → Privacy & Security.

## Build and run locally (dev)

```bash
swift run
```

## Build a clickable app

```bash
./scripts/build-app.sh
```

The app bundle will be at `dist/ImmichSync.app`.

## How it works and configuration

### Core features
- Download assets with filters (photos/videos), optional album filter, and folder structure rules.
- Upload watcher for a local folder (with queue + live sync).
- Scheduling and background launch agent support.
- Menu bar status with sync controls.

### Credentials and security
- API key is saved locally only when you click **Save API Key**.
- Keychain storage is available only when Touch ID is enabled.
- Touch ID gating is optional and protects access to the app UI.

### Storage locations
- Preferences: `UserDefaults`
- App data: `~/Library/Application Support/ImmichSync`
- Keychain entry: service name `ImmichSync` (if enabled)

### Release packaging (unsigned)
```bash
./scripts/package-release.sh
```
Creates `dist/ImmichSync.zip` and `dist/ImmichSync.dmg`.

### GitHub Releases (automatic)
Push a tag like `v0.1.0` and GitHub Actions will build and attach the ZIP/DMG to a published release.
```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```
